# input function
# // Remove the # and run the code, 
# debug the function as needed.

#input("What is your name?)

# Embed the input function inside the print function like we did with the type function
# // Remove the # and run the code,  
# debug the function as needed

#print("Hello" + input("What is your name?") + "!")

# putting a function inside another function is called a nested function

#what is the difference between this:
#print("Hello" + input("What is your name?") + "!")

#and this...
#print("Hello" + input("What is your name?" + "!"))
